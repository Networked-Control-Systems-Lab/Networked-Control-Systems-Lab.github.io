I am a PhD student in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. My current research is on encrypted control, where the objective is to protect the privacy of sensitive data such as personal, financial, or strategically valuable information while they are being processed by a control system. I completed my Bachelor's at UT Austin, and I served in the US Army for 6 years as a member of MAVNI. In my free time, I enjoy playing Tennis, camping, and stargazing. [Jihoon's website]
