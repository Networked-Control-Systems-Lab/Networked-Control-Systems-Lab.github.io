NCS Lab's research into nueromorphic sensing was recently featured on <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE/Aerogram/2025-2026/articles/30-robotic-vision-event-camera">Purdue AAE's AeroGram site</a>. This research explores the advantages of neuromorphic sensors (and event cameras, in particular) in robotic sensing and autonomous decision making, allowing robots to react nimbly to changes in their environment just as a human would.
